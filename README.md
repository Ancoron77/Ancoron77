- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ancoron77
- 👀 I’m interested mostly in PC Gaming and hardware, such as custom watercooling. I am working on a cooling loop as we speak, because I always do.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to write and understand a bit of Javascript, as well as React, in order to design the Front End for a portable messenger.
     I want it to be a sleek assistant that offers quick access to a toolbox and directory of company manuals, forms and reference guides. 
     
     Also a Forum with a mobile-friendly UI with simple Social Media functions (status posts, camera uploads and VoIP conference calls). 
  
  However, the main feature is the Messenger. A market place for exchange of information, with a variety of themed rooms and formal levels.
  preconfigured with individual access rights, permissions and role distribution for each coworker, based on a tier-system that directly
  relates to their carreer level and business experience. The App will be exclusively available to company staff
  and only to those actually on duty as it syncs with each one's roster via shared calendar and simply shuts down during time Off, sick-leave and holidays by design. 
  
  
- 💞️ I hope to achieve collaboration with people from different departments who are involved in our day to day business by creating a central hub where every bit 
  of information trickles in and merges into a bigger picture. Going forward, I'd love to work on automated workflows for optimized data storage, distribution and 
  digital documentation.
